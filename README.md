# Project Initialization
## Objective
The backend for the Airbnb Clone project is designed to provide a robust and scalable foundation for managing user interactions, property listings, bookings, and payments. This backend will support various functionalities required to mimic the core features of Airbnb, ensuring a smooth experience for users and hosts.

## Project Goals
1. User Management: Implement a secure system for user registration, authentication, and profile management.
2. Property Management: Develop features for property listing creation, updates, and retrieval.
3. Booking System: Create a booking mechanism for users to reserve properties and manage booking details.
4. Payment Processing: Integrate a payment system to handle transactions and record payment details.
5. Review System: Allow users to leave reviews and ratings for properties.
6. Data Optimization: Ensure efficient data retrieval and storage through database optimizations.

## Features Overview
### API Documentation
1. OpenAPI Standard: The backend APIs are documented using the OpenAPI standard to ensure clarity and ease of integration.
2. Django REST Framework: Provides a comprehensive RESTful API for handling CRUD operations on user and property data.
GraphQL: Offers a flexible and efficient query mechanism for interacting with the backend.
### User Authentication
1. Endpoints: /users/, /users/{user_id}/
2. Features: Register new users, authenticate, and manage user profiles.
### Property Management
1. Endpoints: /properties/, /properties/{property_id}/
2. Features: Create, update, retrieve, and delete property listings.
### Booking System

2. authorization: giving user feedback when given access to the database
3. rate limiting: limit number of password and bookings
### security
security is important so as to protect personal data of users and financial information

# CI/CD Pipeline
A CI/CD pipeline consists of several automated stages that a new code change must pass through.  Developers merge their code frequently, and the pipeline automatically builds and runs tests to ensure the new code integrates smoothly without breaking the existing codebase. Tools that can be used for this include:
1. GitHub Actions
2. Azure DevOps
3. Kubernetes
4. Jenkins
